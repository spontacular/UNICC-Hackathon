Refugee Crisis,Amid pandemics and environmental disasters  designers and architects have been forced to imagine a world in which the only way to move forward is to look back.,AT ITS CORE  design is an inherently futurist medium. In the 1960s  as the writer Maggie Gram has noted  key figures in the Modern design movement often used the word “design” indistinguishably from the word “planning.” This isn’t surprising: Design  like planning  was the profession most concerned with the future. Today is not so different  but what we mean by “the future ” a utopian ideal throughout much of the 20th century  is now undeniably much darker as we progress further into the 21st. To look ahead at what role design will play on an increasingly troubled planet takes us back to the fundamental polysemy behind the word itself. At various times it has encompassed drawing and architecture  products and graphics — in fact  everything short of the creation of the world itself (and  in the risible concept of “intelligent design ” sometimes that  too). Once industrial design became a profession in the early 20th century  the promiscuity of its aims and undefined nature of its objectives meant that designers felt they could do very nearly anything. In its most heroic phase  the mid-20th century  industrial designers gave themselves over to pronouncements that suggested they alone held the key to this savage parade. “What are the boundaries of design?” was the question posed in 1969 to Charles Eames  who  with his partner  Ray  designed chairs  toys  housing  films  exhibitions and  to a certain extent  the very nature of communication. Eames responded  “What are the boundaries of problems?”,Amid pandemics and environmental disasters  designers and architects have been forced to imagine a world in which the only way to move forward is to look back.,The New York Times,,Design for the Future When the Future Is Bleak,,2020-09-28T13:00:12+0000,TStyle,T Magazine,article,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/28/t-magazine/design-future-pandemic-climate.html,News,,nyt://article/ec16c822-eff4-55ec-b480-7149956c1520

Choi and others  teenagers from around the globe are inventive  romantic and above all empowered.,Now  more than anytime in recent history  we’re hearing the triumphant roar of women of color as they break down longstanding barriers in art  film and literature. In young adult literature in particular  inventive  international stories told in newly empowered women’s voices are claiming their rightful place at the table. Take these five new Y.A. books  ranging from fantasy to realistic fiction to memoir. In these authors’ hands  non-Western sensibilities might reign in a vivid and original Yoruban religion-based world  or classical settings might be reinterpreted to create a universe in which beauty is not tied to race. A heartbreaking fictional front row seat to the Syrian refugee emergency is offset by a humorous true tale of growing up an Iranian-American immigrant without a green card. And a very modern romance proves that  despite divides both cultural and digital  love still wins. So do Y.A. readers  when it comes to seeing exhilaratingly new kinds of characters sharing space.,In books by Tomi Adeyemi  Mary H.K.

Refugee Crisis,From a tiny village in the country’s rural east  a leading nationalist intellectual builds a vision for the future of his movement across Europe.,Götz Kubitschek  a self-proclaimed “rightist intellectual ” lives in a medieval manor house in Schnellroda  a rural village in eastern Germany. From this isolated  antique outpost  Kubitschek  who is 47  wields considerable influence over far-right thinkers  activists and politicians across Germany  who make regular pilgrimages to Schnellroda for an audience with him. The manor serves as the headquarters for the magazine and publishing house that Kubitschek runs with his wife  the writer Ellen Kositza  and also for a rightist think tank  the plainly named Institute for State Policy  and a small organic farm where he raises rabbits and goats. Kubitschek calls himself a conservative  battling to preserve Germany’s “ethno-cultural identity ” which he says is threatened by immigration and the alienating effects of modernity. He identifies as part of the German “New Right ” which seeks to dissociate itself from the “old right ” which in Germany means Nazis. German political scientists  by contrast  classify the brand of thinking Kubitschek ascribes to as either an ideological “hinge” between conservatism and right-wing extremism  or as simply extremist — not vastly different  in other words  from the old right. Kubitschek  however  presents his views with a disarming  Teutonic idealism that recalls a Germany that long preceded the rise of Hitler.

Refugee Crisis,Prime Minister Justin Trudeau met with leaders to discuss carbon emissions  Canadian women’s golf got a shot in the arm and history was made on a telecast.,Donald J. Trump has not yet moved into the White House but his anticipated policies are already spurring debate over what actions  if any  Canada will need to take in response. That was the case on Friday when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau met with the provincial and territorial leaders to work out a national approach to pricing on carbon emissions. Before the meeting  Mr. Trudeau set out a plan where the price — either through a fossil fuel tax or a cap-and-trade system of emission allowances — would reach 50 Canadian dollars  or about $38  a metric ton  or 2 205 pounds  over five years. He also warned that provinces that did not buy in would have the price imposed on them. During the presidential election campaign  Mr. Trump said that he would pull the United States out of the climate change commitments made by the Obama administration. Some Canadians  mostly Conservative politicians  say the economy will be in jeopardy if Canada goes ahead with carbon pricing in the absence of American action. But when I looked into the debate  I also found people who argued that moving now on carbon emissions could give Canada a competitive advantage.,Prime Minister Justin Trudeau met with leaders to discuss carbon emissions  Canadian women’s golf got a shot in the arm and history was made on a telecast.,The New York Times,,Canada Today: Emissions Policy  Bird-Hunting and Meat Pie,,2016-12-09T21:09:01+0000,Foreign,World,article,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/09/world/canada/canada-today-emissions-policy-bird-hunting-and-meat-pie.html,News,,nyt://article/60f97b3d-c648-52c5-950d-7acbd8fd9a81

Refugee Crisis,Immigration is an emotional issue. Three new books offer rational perspective.,From Hobbes and Hegel to John Stuart Mill and John Rawls  the seminal figures of Western political theory are united in their almost complete neglect of the topic of immigration. No doubt they have their reasons. Who among them witnessed anything like the global refugee crisis of 2015? Or the anxieties about national identity that it inflamed? Be that as it may  with hostility toward immigrants and refugees fueling the “Brexit” movement and the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump  we could use some deep thinking right now about the relationship between the state and its citizens. This deep thinking would no longer start with the assumption that we already know who is included in that relationship (thanks for nothing  John Locke!)  but rather would inquire how  in light of often conflicting values like local democracy and global justice  we should go about figuring that out.,Immigration is an emotional issue.

Refugee Crisis,Faced with an influx of new Arab neighbors  a conservative neighborhood in Istanbul struggles with the question of what it means to be a Turk.,In an old part of Istanbul  in a district named Fatih for the Muslim conqueror  tucked inside ancient Byzantine walls in a neighborhood known as Karagumruk  there is a narrow barbershop with pistachio green and glittery countertops called Golden Scissors. When I visited one evening in late June  during Ramadan  every chair was occupied. The religious holiday this year required 17 straight hours of daily abstinence from eating  drinking  smoking or having sex  so just before breaking fast  at the sunset hour  a happy madness set in. Out on the street  women rushed by laden with bags; spaghetti-limbed boys  delirious with hunger and hormones  threw balls against the wall  sometimes at people’s heads. Inside Golden Scissors  men visited for a trim or a cut  given by an excitable man of 40 named Murat  who wore the long  straight beard  full-bodied pants and fez-shaped cap often seen on the devout. He was talking about the events of the previous night when Istanbul’s main airport was bombed.,Faced with an influx of new Arab neighbors  a conservative neighborhood in Istanbul struggles with the question of what it means to be a Turk.,The New York Times,36,The Erdogan Loyalists and the Syrian Refugees,Turks and Strangers,2016-07-20T09:00:06+0000,Magazine,Magazine,article,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/24/magazine/erdogans-people.html,News,,nyt://article/f47fecac-b02f-58e3-b5ac-825f3332c3a0

Refugee Crisis,A refugee crisis  a Greek debt showdown  Russian aggression and terrorism in the streets. How 2015 has threatened to undo the European Union.,A few weeks ago  I visited the fence that made Hungary a symbol of European anxiety. Chain-link and razor wire  it slices through pastures as it traces Hungary’s southern border.

Police officers and soldiers were stationed every few hundred yards  and they examined my passport at almost every checkpoint. They seemed bored  perhaps because the flood of refugees and migrants had mostly abated. The fence had sealed Hungary off  and that made Laszlo Toroczkai — the 37-year-old mayor of Asotthalom  a Hungarian farming town on the Serbian border  and a rising ultranationalist star of far-right European politics — very happy.,A refugee crisis  a Greek debt showdown  Russian aggression and terrorism in the streets.

He made the same move last night  defending his administration’s Libya policy by distancing himself from the “some” who “question why America should intervene at all ” and the “others” who “have suggested that we broaden our military mission beyond the task of protecting the Libyan people  and do whatever it takes to bring down Qaddafi and usher in a new government.” The proper course  the president argued  lay somewhere in between  with an intervention designed to save civilian lives  prevent a destabilizing refugee crisis  and “stop Qaddafi’s forces in their tracks ” without committing American power (and American troops  and American money …) to the task of changing Libya’s regime outright. Here was his defense of of making war (a word he never used  of course) on Qaddafi’s regime while stopping short of toppling the dictator directly:,Why the “false choice” between non-intervention and regime change in Libya probably isn’t false at all.,The New York Times,,Not All Choices Are False,,2011-03-29T14:01:53+0000,,Opinion,article,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/29/not-all-choices-are-false/,,,nyt://article/5fb71eac-3333-59e7-965f-805c81943dd8

Eric Rudolph: Murder  Myth  and the Pursuit of an American Outlaw. By Maryanne Vollers. (HarperCollins  $25.95.) As in “Ghosts of Mississippi ” her 1995 book about the murder of Medgar Evers  Vollers deploys the devices of the true-crime thriller in “Lone Wolf” to explore right-wing extremism. This time her subject is Eric Rudolph  who killed two people in a series of bombings at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics  two abortion clinics and a gay nightclub. The first part of the book is told mostly from the perspective of agents from the F.B.I.  the Bureau of Alcohol  Tobacco  Firearms and Explosives  and local police officers  whose bureaucratic turf wars roiled the investigation and contributed to the mistaken suspicion that Richard Jewell  a security guard  was the Olympic bomber. During Rudolph’s five years as a fugitive in the woods of North Carolina  news reports assumed he had a network of supporters. But Vollers believes the “Run  Rudolph  Run!” memorabilia the locals sold were a tribute to the myth of the outlaw  not an endorsement of his actions. Rudolph was introduced to militant ultraconservatism by a father figure named Tom Branham  but he never formed a long-term allegiance with a radical group. After his capture in 2003  the book’s viewpoint shifts to that of his defense team  whose efforts would save him from the death penalty. The portrait that emerges — as Rudolph befriends his lawyers and explains himself in extensive correspondence with Vollers — is humanizing  almost sympathetic. But the author ultimately agrees with the former F.B.I. behavioral analyst who deemed Rudolph a psychopath.

But Hurricane Katrina delivered America its own refugee crisis  arguably the worst since Sherman's army burned its way across the South. And though the word ''refugee'' is offensive to some  and not accurate according to international law  it conveys a fundamental truth: these are people who will be unable to return home for months  possibly years. Many almost certainly will make new homes in new places.  ,The New York Times,1,No Fixed Address,THE NATION: OFF THE MAP; No Fixed Address,2005-09-11T05:00:00+0000,Week in Review Desk,Week in Review,article,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/11/weekinreview/no-fixed-address.html,News,,nyt://article/680be0bc-be86-51ad-8cd4-f143cb448688

We have decisively changed the carbon cycle  the nitrogen cycle and the rate of extinction. We have created ­new atomic isotopes and plastiglomerates that may persist for millions of years. We have built mega­cities that will leave a durable footprint long after they have vanished. We have altered the pH of the oceans and have moved so many life-forms around the globe — inadvertently and ­intentionally — that we are creating novel ecosystems everywhere. Since the late-18th-century industrialization that marks the Anthropocene’s beginnings  humans have ­shaken Earth’s life systems with a profundity that the paleontologist Anthony Barnosky has likened to an asteroid strike. ,Diane Ackerman surveys the technology and innovations that define our human-dominated epoch.,The New York Times,10,Future Footprints,Future Footprints,2014-09-05T14:53:29+0000,BookReview,Books,article,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/books/review/the-human-age-by-diane-ackerman.html,Review,,nyt://article/a523d4a8-1462-5f28-81c6-a0f039e32cc4

The first settlers in the area of Memphis arrived on the bluffs overlooking the Mississippi River more than 1 000 years ago. The Chickasaw forcibly displaced these people and then lived there for eight centuries until 1838  when the U.S. government scattered the entire tribe to Oklahoma and parts further west so its citizens could develop the land. The Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto first set eyes on the bluffs in 1541. Other explorers passed through over the next century and in 1739 the French built Fort Assumption. The French  Spanish  and the Chickasaw fought over the land for the balance of the 18th century until it became a part of the U.S. in 1797. The area's original American owners  Gen. James Winchester  Judge John Overton  and Gen. Andrew Jackson (who later sold his share and went on to become President)  established the town in 1819  and named it Memphis  after the ancient Egyptian city on the Nile. Riverboatmen gave young Memphis a reputation for brawls and bawdiness  while mosquitoes gave it a history of yellow fever epidemics  which in the 1880's claimed more than half the city's population and jeopardized its charter. A sewage system  the first of its kind  helped finally conquer the epidemic. Between the river traffic and cotton crops  the city prospered  attracting Irish and German immigrants  and by the 20th century was on its way to becoming the unofficial capital of the mid-south. Elvis Presley  who expanded the city's rhythm and blues tradition to become the world's first rock-and-roll idol  remains the city's most enduring contribution to popular culture. In 1991  the Lorraine Motel  where civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968  was opened as the National Civil Rights Museum.
