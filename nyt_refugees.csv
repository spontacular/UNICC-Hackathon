Afghanistan Refugee,Our supposed ally had a special desk devoted to managing Osama bin Laden. How can the U.S. fight extremism when we’re unable to confront it where it really lives?,Shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks  I went to live and report for The New York Times in Afghanistan. I would spend most of the next 12 years there  following the overthrow of the Taliban  feeling the excitement of the freedom and prosperity that was promised in its wake and then watching the gradual dissolution of that hope. A new Constitution and two rounds of elections did not improve the lives of ordinary Afghans; the Taliban regrouped and found increasing numbers of supporters for their guerrilla actions; by 2006  as they mounted an ambitious offensive to retake southern Afghanistan and unleashed more than a hundred suicide bombers  it was clear that a deadly and determined opponent was growing in strength  not losing it.

By Benjamin Lebert. Translated by Peter Constantine. (Knopf  $16.95.) Writers are supposed to learn restraint over time  but Lebert  a 23-year-old German  already has that quality down pat. He does a lot with few words in this follow-up to his 1999 debut novel  ""Crazy."" Just over 100 small pages  ""The Bird Is a Raven"" depicts a single evening's conversation between strangers on a train. The narrator  Paul  tentatively encourages the friendly overtures of his bunkmate  Henry  only to find that his new acquaintance won't stop talking. As Henry spins a long  meandering account of his stormy relationship with two friends  Paul can't make up his mind whether the other man is likably eccentric or just plain crazy. One minute Henry seems like a nice enough chap  and the next he's talking about violent urges  sexual hang-ups and repulsive digestive processes. (""Can you imagine how disgusting it is to have diarrhea  all the time and everywhere?"" he asks.) Lebert explores the limits of trust  blending broad humor and sudden bursts of melodrama while maintaining a sense of delicately balanced tension. Even the novel's apparent weaknesses  like the characters' identical narrative voices  turn out to be part of his master plan.",Etelka Lehoczky Chronicle article on fiction books The Bird is a Raven by Benjamin Lebert  Billie Morgan by Joolz Denby  Against Gravity by Farnoosh Moshiri  Becoming Strangers by Louise Dean and Time Won't Let Me by Bill Scheft; photo from book Vitamin D: New Perspectives in Drawing (M),The New York Times,18,Fiction Chronicle,Fiction Chronicle,2006-01-29T05:00:00+0000,Book Review Desk,Books,article,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/29/books/review/fiction-chronicle.html,Review,,nyt://article/445d0b48-1230-5b5b-bd69-d7a76a1cab45

(The cast includes the critically acclaimed British actors Jeremy Northam  Shirley Henderson and Stephen Fry  all working at scale just so they can be in a Winterbottom film.) Sterne's book has frequently been described as unfilmable  which is precisely what interested Winterbottom.

It features many of the avant-garde flourishes now associated with writers like Dave Eggers and Jonathan Safran Foer.

Often these worries are expressed  and to some extent mitigated  by means of extravagant visual fantasies that picture a world of gleaming  high-rise cities  flying cars and soulful robots.,Michael Winterbottom  a prolific and stylistically promiscuous director (&quot;The Claim &quot; &quot;24 Hour Party People &quot; &quot;In This World&quot;) tries his able hand at dystopian science fiction. Sometime in the future  the world is divided between gleaming  affluent cities and the world outside  called &quot;afuera&quot; in the global polyglot idiom. An insurance investigator (Tim Robbins) comes to Shanghai to investigate a factory that is producing counterfeit travel documents  and falls into a brief affair with the prime suspect (Samantha Morton). The story and the characters  mopily played by the two lead actors  are less interesting than the futuristic ambience Mr. Winterbottom has gleaned from the realities of the present. Rather than relying on special effects or elaborate set design  he filmed &quot;Code 46&quot; in Shanghai and Dubai  in the fluorescence of airport and hotels and the neon and dust of urban streets. The movie is thick with disquieting  not always coherent ideas about the effects of globalization on human intimacy  but its real achievement is to distill the fugitive moods of contemporary life into an entrancing atmosphere of muted longing. &#151; A.

When her mother is chased out of her job at a dusty Kabul hospital  a young girl disguises herself as a boy and goes to work for a sympathetic shopkeeper  and as her ordeal reveals the many forms of Taliban brutality  the film also has moments of lyricism  tenderness and even comedy  as in one unforgettable sequence that explores the paradoxical idea of radical Islamist sex education. — A.

Afghanistan Refugee,Review of year's notable ideas and developments cites movie American Splendor  which blurs line between fantasy and reality using pretext that any person can be truthfully represented in more than one way; photo (M),In ''American Splendor '' Paul Giamatti plays Harvey Pekar  a grumpy file clerk at a Cleveland hospital who records the small oddities and frustrations of his daily existence in a series of comic-strip vignettes. ''Ordinary life is pretty complex stuff '' he observes  and the movie  which came out in August  takes this statement as both its theme and its organizing principle. As fans of the comic book from which the film takes its title will know  Harvey Pekar is a real person  and he appears in the movie not only in the rumpled  jowly form of Giamatti but also in his own unremarkable skin. Giamatti's Pekar ambles through the real streets of Cleveland  while Pekar's Pekar shows up from time to time  posed against a blank white background that suggests an uninked comic-book page. One of them acts out the other's real life  while the person whose real life it is comments on the action.,Review of year's notable ideas and developments cites movie American Splendor  which blurs line between fantasy and reality using pretext that any person can be truthfully represented in more than one way; photo (M),The New York Times,56,2003: THE 3rd ANNUAL YEAR IN IDEAS; Cinema Meets Real Life,2003: THE 3rd ANNUAL YEAR IN IDEAS; Cinema Meets Real Life,2003-12-14T05:00:00+0000,Magazine Desk,Magazine,article,https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/14/magazine/2003-the-3rd-annual-year-in-ideas-cinema-meets-real-life.html,News,,nyt://article/0ebad1b9-911e-5b0f-a76b-a5b1acb69116

The film opens with a scene of a documentary being shot -- we see a clapper that says ''Party Monster Take 1'' -- in which James St. James (played by Seth Green) sits by a pool in bright yellow lounging pajamas being interviewed about his drugged-out life in the 90's and a murder committed by his club-kid friend Michael Alig (Macaulay Culkin). But this scene is not simply based on reality; it is based on a documentary about reality. Right down to the clownish yellow outfit  poolside setting and campy  drag-queen voice  Mr. Green's fake interview mimics an actual interview from a 1997 Cinemax documentary also called ''Party Monster'' and also made by the co-directors of the new movie  Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato.,Caryn James article considers fictional films made to look like documentaries; suggests they  like reality TV  reflect cultural shift; focuses on works by James St James and new films by Gus Van Sant and Ben Coccio based on Columbine shootings; photos (M),The New York Times,15,The New Cinematic Realism,FILM; The New Cinematic Realism,2003-10-05T05:00:00+0000,Arts and Leisure Desk,Movies,article,https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/05/movies/film-the-new-cinematic-realism.html,News,,nyt://article/db5c372e-6247-5962-b8b7-6051efa41b7c

There have been two Thomas Hardy adaptations (''Jude'' and ''The Claim'')  an exercise in grim British realism (''Wonderland'')  a Balkan war movie (''Welcome to Sarajevo'') and  last summer  a gaudy chronicle of the Manchester rave scene (''24 Hour Party People'').,Michael Winterbottom's film about two young Afghan refugees trying to reach London begins on the Pakistani border and unfolds on the blurry frontier between documentary and fiction. Shot in digital video with non-professional actors  it has a harsh immediacy that forces you to confront the terrible plight of the world's displaced people one face at a time. But this story of peril  frustration and heartbreak also has moments of great warmth and vitality. Jamal (Jamal Udin Torabi)  the younger of the two travelers  has a tough  impish joie de vivre  and as he and his cousin make their way west  they encounter decency as well as indifference. This movie has the paradoxical effect of forcing you to confront the enormity of the world's cruelty and the overwhelming scale of its suffering  and at the same time making you feel glad to be in it. — A.O.

Afghanistan Refugee,Afghan refugees in Pakistan who used to make rugs depicting Soviet occupation are now weaving rugs incorporating icons of American invasion; photo (Currents column) (S),Afghan refugees in Pakistan made rugs depicting Kalashnikov rifles  guided missiles and MIG jets during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan from 1979 to 1989. When the Soviets left  war-rug production stopped. Now refugees near Peshawar  Pakistan  are making small matlike rugs showing cartoonish images of American tanks and helicopters. The spelling is often incorrect  as above  ''Afghans liderated from terrorist.'' ''We sell a lot of them '' said Chris Walter  the owner of Yayla Tribal Rugs  a wholesale company in Cambridge  Mass. ''We can have them made to order if we want.'' But no two are alike. Buyers include military officers as well as civilians like Peter Roy  a lawyer in Ellsworth  Me. ''Having a war rug on the floor always breaks the ice when discussing politics '' he said. The rugs ($200 to $400) can be seen at Kea Carpets and Kilims  477 Atlantic Avenue  Brooklyn  through June. Information: (718) 222-8087. They are also available for $185 to $225 from www.rugreview.com  or (603) 744-9191. ABC Carpet & Home has 50 rugs costing $100 to $1 000; 888 Broadway (19th Street)  (212) 473-3000. Some people  like Leslie Stroh  publisher of Rug News in New York  say to buy them for love  not money. ''There's no collectible nature to them '' he said.

He turned U.S. policy on its head  directly demanding the ouster of Yasir Arafat while holding out the possibility -- without specific guidelines -- of a Palestinian state within three years.     The position coalesced suddenly out of the administration's slow  painstaking debate about the terms and timing of a Palestinian state. The tough line emerged  senior officials said  after Mr. Bush read intelligence reports showing that even as Mr. Arafat was denouncing suicide attacks  he was financing Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades  the group that has claimed responsibility for several such attacks. Later in the week  Mr. Bush said that if Palestinians did not embrace the measures he suggested  the U.S. might cut off aid.   ,The New York Times,2,FRONT LINES,FRONT LINES,2002-06-30T05:00:00+0000,Week in Review Desk,Week in Review,article,https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/30/weekinreview/front-lines.html,News,,nyt://article/73403511-f080-5d80-a269-bb56c6956b7a

The blast was the deadliest of 40 bombings that have rocked Pakistani cities this year  and the government has blamed archrival India for many of the previous attacks. Pakistan's military ruler Gen. Pervez Musharraf condemned Tuesday's ``dastardly act of terrorism '' but did not place blame. The explosion  the first in Islamabad this year  occurred while workers were unloading the crates from a truck  witnesses said. The blast triggered a stampede of workers and shoppers from the city's largest fruit and vegetable market. ``I heard the explosion and saw fruit flying in the air '' said Hasan Khan  a shop owner who was just 20 yards from the blast. ``People started running and screaming. We pulled down the shutters on our shop and left.'' No group immediately claimed responsibility  and police were investigating. The truck arrived from Kurram Agency in Pakistan's northwestern tribal region bordering Afghanistan  police and witnesses said. The vegetable market is located on the city's outskirts in a relatively poor neighborhood. Many of the victims were Afghan refugees who work unloading trucks. Pakistan has been plagued by political violence  including periodic bomb blasts  for years. However  since Musharraf seized power last October  ousting an elected civilian government  overall political unrest has declined. And Islamabad has traditionally been calm even when other Pakistani cities were aflame. ,ISLAMABAD  Pakistan -- A powerful bomb placed in a crate of grapes ripped through a crowded market Tuesday morning  killing 16 people and wounding more than 80 in Pakistan's capital  police said.

Syria Refugee,In her column  Hillary Chute explores work from Riad Sattouf  Don Brown  Molly Crabapple and Marwan Hisham.,Riad Sattouf’s parents met in the early 1970s in a cafeteria at the Sorbonne. They were both students: Clémentine from Brittany  and Abdel-Razak  on scholarship  from a village in Syria. Riad was born in 1978. With a young child and a newly minted doctorate in history  Abdel-Razak — whose stated aspiration for his son  to become “the Arab of the future ” lends Sattouf’s autobiographical series its name — moved his family to Libya for a teaching position before eventually landing in Syria  in the Sunni village of Ter Maaleh  where he had grown up. Sattouf’s graphic narratives of his country-and-culture-hopping childhood — of which  with THE ARAB OF THE FUTURE 3: A Childhood in the Middle East  1985-1987 (Metropolitan/Holt  $27)  we now have three volumes in an ongoing story — are translated from the French by Sam Taylor. They reveal the easy charm also displayed in Marjane Satrapi’s “Persepolis” volumes  setting up a central  and often amusing  tension between a pictured child protagonist and that same person’s adult  retrospective narration. The reader easily shuttles back and forth between naïve and knowing perspectives  the two combined in the space of a frame.,In her column  Hillary Chute explores work from Riad Sattouf  Don Brown  Molly Crabapple and Marwan Hisham.,The New York Times,23,Comics of Violence and Nostalgia From War-Torn Syria,Graphic Content,2018-10-12T09:00:05+0000,BookReview,Books,article,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/12/books/review/arab-of-the-future-3-riad-sattouf.html,Review,,nyt://article/9df9348f-68fe-5089-bc52-ccb30ab3c4f9

There is a notable drive toward streamlining  with fewer galleries this year — a total of 198 from 31 countries at Piers 92/94  the contiguous exhibition space. The timeline is being tightened  as well  to create less of a divide between the past and the present  between post-World War II art (usually found on the sleepier Pier 92) and newer work.

Syria Refugee,In books by Tomi Adeyemi  Mary H.K. Choi and others  teenagers from around the globe are inventive  romantic and above all empowered.,Now  more than anytime in recent history  we’re hearing the triumphant roar of women of color as they break down longstanding barriers in art  film and literature. In young adult literature in particular  inventive  international stories told in newly empowered women’s voices are claiming their rightful place at the table. Take these five new Y.A. books  ranging from fantasy to realistic fiction to memoir. In these authors’ hands  non-Western sensibilities might reign in a vivid and original Yoruban religion-based world  or classical settings might be reinterpreted to create a universe in which beauty is not tied to race. A heartbreaking fictional front row seat to the Syrian refugee emergency is offset by a humorous true tale of growing up an Iranian-American immigrant without a green card. And a very modern romance proves that  despite divides both cultural and digital  love still wins. So do Y.A. readers  when it comes to seeing exhilaratingly new kinds of characters sharing space.,In books by Tomi Adeyemi  Mary H.K.

Syria Refugee,The city’s treasures lie just below the surface: world-class restaurants  Brazil-class music and an ever-ebullient arts scene.,Chaotically refined  verdantly concrete  intimately gargantuan: The most populous metropolis in South America was but a middling coffee city until the mid-20th century  when an influx of northeastern migrants set off a growth spurt that shows no sign of stopping. With seemingly infinite skyscrapers nearly blocking out the sun (when its famously overcast skies don’t do it first)  visitors don’t always take to the city instantly. But its treasures lie below the surface: world-class restaurants  Brazil-class music and an ever-ebullient arts scene  from alternative theaters to sparkling new museums. And though Paulistanos are often stereotyped as harried and overworked  that’s only compared to other Brazilians; compared to most megacity dwellers they are downright easygoing. Meanwhile  there’s ever more  to see  as the slow-cooker of progress — or is it gentrification? — regenerates the once-abandoned historic center  block by block. But downtown is still no hipster paradise. It’s as vibrant and culturally alive as it is gritty and pickpockety  enough so that many wealthy residents stick to greener  wealthier areas. Visitors  of course  can take in the best of both.

I sometimes have fleeting antagonisms: toward a waitress I feel is being too performative in her friendship with a coffee shop regular  or that woman on the subway eating a plum really loudly. But in general  I have a smiley face and at the risk of sounding bonkers  I make friends with almost everyone I come across. What I’m missing  I’ve come to realize after a summer of cookouts and heart-to-hearts and hiking trips  is an enemy.,Sometimes what you’re looking for has been right there all along  shouting over women on cable news shows.,The New York Times,9,Stephen Miller Is the Enemy of My Dreams,The Enemy of My Dreams,2017-09-02T19:31:00+0000,OpEd,Opinion,article,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/02/opinion/sunday/stephen-miller-immigration.html,Op-Ed,,nyt://article/b87932d0-66dd-50f0-9c79-91dbe27335f2
Syria Refugee,The editor in chief has taken on a seemingly impossible task: reinventing the glossy magazine for a hyperempathetic generation.,If you are  like me  a person with no sense of style and a stomach paunch  you might understand why dressing for a fashion show would be a psychological challenge. The day before my first one  I begged my best-dressed co-worker to chaperone my visit to a fast-fashion outlet. I’d coveted a pleated gold-foil skirt I’d seen on the store’s website. My co-worker had approved the skirt on the model. I tried it on. She did not approve it on me. In person  the gold foil looked cheap  the waistband of the skirt unflattering. Instead  she picked out a rose-colored accordion skirt that I would never have thought to buy. I put it on the next morning. Four hours later  I spilled steak juice all down my front.,The editor in chief has taken on a seemingly impossible task: reinventing the glossy magazine for a hyperempathetic generation.,The New York Times,29,Elaine Welteroth  Teen Vogue’s Refashionista,Refashionista,2017-08-31T09:00:25+0000,Magazine,Magazine,article,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/31/magazine/elaine-welteroth-teen-vogues-refashionista.html,News,,nyt://article/12db1486-2559-5331-ba5c-f7e37621696d

Syria Refugee,The identity politics of the president’s supporters have always been deceptively complicated — but his own have been less so.,In December  seven months before President Trump announced his intention to ban transgender people from serving in the military  I attended one of Trump’s postelection victory rallies  in Grand Rapids  Mich.  with a Trump supporter named Jayne Locke. As it happened  Locke was a transgender veteran. This was not one of those journalistic exercises in deliberate expectation-thwarting; it had happened more or less by chance. On my way to Grand Rapids  I had been canvassing Facebook looking for Trump supporters who were going to the rally  and Locke was the one who wrote me back. When she did  she was quick to note something that was not readily apparent from her Facebook page: “I’m not sure if you are aware of this or not  but I am not only a Trump supporter but also a transsexual woman Trump supporter.”,The identity politics of the president’s supporters have always been deceptively complicated — but his own have been less so.,The New York Times,,The Emptiness of Trump’s Promises of Tolerance,,2017-07-28T16:31:44+0000,Magazine,Magazine,article,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/28/magazine/the-emptiness-of-trumps-promises-of-tolerance.html,News,,nyt://article/ca489c4c-e532-506b-96b4-88c20aa46502

Syria Refugee,Trump’s travel ban would cut refugee admissions to the U.S. by more than half. This violates international agreements  American laws and common sense.,President Trump’s “travel ban” has drawn much scrutiny for its attempt to prohibit citizens from six Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. But the executive order — which this week was struck down by a second federal court and seems headed to the Supreme Court this summer — has another important part: a reduction  by more than half  of refugee admissions  to 50 000 from 110 000. This provision is bad for the country for security and economic reasons. As discussed in a forthcoming report by the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinical Program  it also potentially violates international commitments and American laws.,Trump’s travel ban would cut refugee admissions to the U.S. by more than half. This violates international agreements  American laws and common sense.,The New York Times,,We Should Keep Our Word on Refugees,,2017-06-15T14:18:51+0000,OpEd,Opinion,article,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/15/opinion/the-many-reasons-why-admitting-fewer-refugees-is-wrong.html,Op-Ed,,nyt://article/7fe0b69b-54af-5fda-b047-1498fa9979f2
Syria Refugee,A building spree of houses of worship is furthering the Islamicization of the country and providing an ongoing economic engine.,In Turkey  mosques have a dual spiritual and economic purpose. This surprised me when I first moved to the country more than a decade ago. I expected God and money to be kept separate  at least outwardly  more in keeping with the discreet  cash-in-envelopes Christian churches of my youth. Yet around the exterior of the tiny  seafoam green 19th-century mosque across the street from my Istanbul home  I discovered an array of shops: a locksmith  a market  a kebab joint  a teahouse and a rotisserie vendor whose delicious  buttery chickens twirled all day outside. One of the imams who preached at the mosque was a part-time real estate agent. The attempted military coup last July lasted until the wee hours of the night  yet my little green mosque was  as usual  open and ready early the next morning for prayer; the locksmith whose shop was part of the complex waddled in by 9 a.m.  and the happy blend of prayer and small-time hustle in Istanbul continued unabated.,A building spree of houses of worship is furthering the Islamicization of the country and providing an ongoing economic engine.,The New York Times,46,Reading Erdogan’s Ambitions in Turkey’s New Mosques,The Second Conquest,2017-06-14T09:00:09+0000,Magazine,Magazine,article,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/14/magazine/reading-erdogans-ambitions-in-turkeys-new-mosques.html,News,,nyt://article/8cc17604-b438-5e04-8972-a7563e152f8d

When I visited one evening in late June  during Ramadan  every chair was occupied. The religious holiday this year required 17 straight hours of daily abstinence from eating  drinking  smoking or having sex  so just before breaking fast  at the sunset hour  a happy madness set in. Out on the street  women rushed by laden with bags; spaghetti-limbed boys  delirious with hunger and hormones  threw balls against the wall  sometimes at people’s heads. Inside Golden Scissors  men visited for a trim or a cut  given by an excitable man of 40 named Murat  who wore the long  straight beard  full-bodied pants and fez-shaped cap often seen on the devout. He was talking about the events of the previous night when Istanbul’s main airport was bombed.,Faced with an influx of new Arab neighbors  a conservative neighborhood in Istanbul struggles with the question of what it means to be a Turk.,The New York Times,36,The Erdogan Loyalists and the Syrian Refugees,Turks and Strangers,2016-07-20T09:00:06+0000,Magazine,Magazine,article,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/24/magazine/erdogans-people.html,News,,nyt://article/f47fecac-b02f-58e3-b5ac-825f3332c3a0

Syria Refugee,A refugee crisis  a Greek debt showdown  Russian aggression and terrorism in the streets. How 2015 has threatened to undo the European Union.,A few weeks ago  I visited the fence that made Hungary a symbol of European anxiety. Chain-link and razor wire  it slices through pastures as it traces Hungary’s southern border. More than 100 miles long  it was constructed quickly this summer as refugees streamed into the country  heading toward Austria and Germany. Police officers and soldiers were stationed every few hundred yards  and they examined my passport at almost every checkpoint. They seemed bored  perhaps because the flood of refugees and migrants had mostly abated. The fence had sealed Hungary off  and that made Laszlo Toroczkai — the 37-year-old mayor of Asotthalom  a Hungarian farming town on the Serbian border  and a rising ultranationalist star of far-right European politics — very happy.,A refugee crisis  a Greek debt showdown  Russian aggression and terrorism in the streets.

It grows into an unearthly clamor. ‘‘Here they come!’’ someone whispers. Overhead  a long  wavering chevron of beating wings is inked across the darkening sky. Behind it flows others  and there are others behind them  all passing overhead in ever-increasing waves  filling the air with an astonishing barrage of noise and beauty.,Cranes flying south for winter evoke the people seeking refuge below.,The New York Times,22,The Human Flock,The Human Flock,2015-12-02T12:00:19+0000,Magazine,Magazine,article,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/06/magazine/the-human-flock.html,News,,nyt://article/ecd773b1-9457-573a-a574-72c8cfeea7c9

Single men will be admitted only if they fall under the sexual orientation categories or if they travel with their parents.

Iraq Refugee,Television highlights.,9 P.M. (Showtime) SALMON FISHING IN THE YEMEN (2012) The director Lasse Hallstrom transforms Paul Torday’s absurdist political satire — the tale of a visionary sheik (Amr Waked  above left  with Ewan McGregor) with unlimited financial resources intent on creating a recreational paradise for fishermen in a Middle Eastern desert — into a whimsical romantic comedy. Mr. Hallstrom “is a shrewd commercial alchemist with a soft heart ” Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times  and the result “is the cinematic equivalent of turning salt into sugar.” Mr. McGregor plays Dr. Alfred Jones  a British fisheries expert who is approached to evaluate the feasibility of the concept  which would involve either importing 10 000 North Atlantic salmon to Yemen from Britain  or using farmed salmon. Kristin Scott Thomas is Patricia Maxwell  the press secretary for the British prime minister  who seizes on the opportunity to distract the public from political conflicts and score points for her boss. And Emily Blunt is Harriet  the sheik’s assistant  and the unspoken object of Fred’s affection  whose soldier boyfriend (Tom Mison) has gone missing in action. “Whether Harriet and Fred will get together is a question that hovers over the movie ” Mr. Holden said. “The appeal of the film depends on the charm of Mr. McGregor and Ms. Blunt  whose polite but discreetly charged connection is the story’s emotional center.” And although the sheik is the target of an assassination plot by Islamic extremists  “the biggest moment of suspense has nothing to do with international politics or terrorism ” Mr. Holden said. “It comes when those farmed salmon are finally released into the waters of their new home. Will they mill around in confusion or will they jump? It is enough to say that for this moment to be the film’s dramatic turning point is an indication of its softness.”,Television highlights.,The New York Times,8,What’s on Saturday,What’s On Today,2013-05-04T05:00:06+0000,Culture,Arts,article,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/04/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html,Schedule,,nyt://article/bceaf7ec-ee47-5e25-a181-ec6a3ebcdf09

Iraq Refugee,In Hari Kunzru’s fourth novel  an autistic boy disappears in the California desert and many lives intersect around a rock formation called the Pinnacles.,One thing that struck me about the 9/11 footage shown during last year’s anniversary was that in 2001  the people on New York City’s sidewalks had no smartphones with which to record the events of the day. History may well look back on 9/11 as the world’s last underdocumented mega-event. But aside from the absence of phone cameras  the people and streets of September 2001 looked pretty much identical to those of September 2011: the clothes  the hair  the cars. I mention this because it has been only in the past decade that we appear to have entered an aura-free universe in which all eras coexist at once — a state of possibly permanent atemporality given to us courtesy of the Internet. No particular era now dominates. We live in a post-era era without forms of its own powerful enough to brand the times. The zeitgeist of 2012 is that we have a lot of zeit but not much geist. I can’t believe I just wrote that last sentence  but it’s true; there is something psychically sparse about the present era  and artists of all stripes are responding with fresh strategies.,In Hari Kunzru’s fourth novel  an autistic boy disappears in the California desert and many lives intersect around a rock formation called the Pinnacles.,The New York Times,1,Convergences,Convergences,2012-03-08T22:27:27+0000,BookReview,Books,article,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/books/review/gods-without-men-by-hari-kunzru.html,Review,,nyt://article/6a7d8f8f-0cee-532c-8b98-e667b1eb052e
